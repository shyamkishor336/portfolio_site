Theestimation model would have to estimate the depth information directly from the 2D images. We explore two methods in this paper both of which represent human pose as a heatmap. The first one follows (Newell et al. [6]) and (Martinez et al. [7]) where we predict 2D poses and then lift these 2D poses to 3D. The second approach is inspired by (Pavlakos et al. [8]) and involves learning 3D pose directly from the 2D images. We observe that while both these approaches work well, the mean of both their predictions gives us the best mean per-joint prediction error (MPJPE) score."],

Various traditional methods that are being followed till date are easy to break which eventually leads to burglary. To protect the home, there is a need to install expensive security system. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we are proposing an IOT based system with the help of face recognition to develop the smart door lock and unlock system. This project features the controlling of home appliances from a centralized system along with face recognition security which can be monitored remotely. It also gives us the facility to monitor our home remotely and take appropriate actions if any suspicious activities are detected. IOT based system has the feature of alerting the admin even when he/she is inaccessible to the internet which provides added security. Cost-effectiveness and secured home automation is the prime feature of this work. Our work helps to keep personal property safe even in the physical absence of owner"],
